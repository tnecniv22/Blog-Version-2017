Garbage bags lined up on the sidewalks. Bright LED Signs illuminating the night. Musky street scent. Beggars begging for change. Dirty, smelly subway platforms. Police officers everywhere. Horse carriages on the street. Incessant honking. People selling fake brand-name purses. Hustle and bustle of pedestrians.

 Michelin Stars. Wall Street. Broadway. History everywhere. Four billion dollar transportation hub. World Trade Centre. Crand Architecture. The Yankees.

 This is NYC in a nutshell. A marriage between old and new, rich and poor. A place of life and energy. What a city indeed.
