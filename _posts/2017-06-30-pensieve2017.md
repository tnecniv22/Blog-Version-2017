> Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. - Forrest Gump

Since I just watched Forrest Gump yesterday, I wanted to reflect upon my university experience so far by using a box of chocolates. Supposed there was a box of 12 chocolates, entitled Vincent's 2016-2017 school year, this is what you would find inside.
