So you want to learn how to be dejected, right? Here are the steps to get you started.

#### Browse all day
Spend your whole day on your phone, computer, or tablet. Never let an instant go by without looking at a screen. Whether you are at home, at school, or at work, always make sure every available second is spent browsing facebook, instagram, or any other website. Never mind the fact that they gather data about you to feed you information that will satisfy your interests; rather, make sure you keep reading the suggested links that pop up or watch the recommended videos. It will only lead you to more screen time.

#### Get less sleep
Sleep past midnight everyday. Whether its browsing your phone, partying into the early morning hours, or pulling all-nighters, do them all. No wonder you feel terrible when you wake up the next day.

#### Stay in your room
Besides, its raining outside right? Even if it's sunny, and other people are tossing a frisbee or going for a walk, ignore the call to join them. Its better to watch videos on youtube, right? When a friend asks you to hang out with them, politely decline. It's really important to avoid meaningful social interaction.

#### Doubt yourself
There are so many people better than you out in the world. Many are better at sports than you. Many are better looking than you. Many are way smarter than you. You name it. They are all so much better, so why bother trying? Instead, find your self-worth in facebook likes and instagram followers.

#### Despise others
Only notice the negatives about others, and take notice of every little thing that annoys you. Let that feeling grow and fester. If your roommate doesn't do the dishes, despise him for it. If someone is worse at something than you, scoff at them. After all, you're better than them, right?

#### P.S.
You get the idea.
