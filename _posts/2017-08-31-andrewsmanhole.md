During My past co-op term at Andrews.engineer, I had the opportunity of modeling and helping to design a support system for a manhole and pipes that we were going to install in our warehouse.

## Design
This is the design I drafted in Google Sketchup.

About a month later, construction began.

Unfortunately, the manhole support was not finished by the time I left to go back to school. This is how it looked like before my departure:

I also had an opportunity to draft a fire escape floor plan for our warehouse!
