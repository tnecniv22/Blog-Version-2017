Aspiring Architect, Engineer, and Developer. Baseball player, avid reader, and pianist. Above all, a follower of Jesus Christ.
I Study Civil Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

> Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Proverbs 3:5-6

## People I'm Inspired By
These people are architects and engineers whose designs and contributions to the world I greatly admire.

* [T. Y. Lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tung-Yen_Lin), structural engineer who pioneered the use of prestressed concrete. He focused on aesthetics as well as functionality, designing many bridges and buildings, including the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge.

* [Frank Lloyd Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright), American architect who integrated buildings seamlessly with the environment. Some of his works include the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, and Fallingwater, in Pennsylvania.

* [I. M. Pei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._M._Pei), Chinese-American architect who designed the Louvre Pyramids in Paris, and recipient of the Pritzker Prize, the highest honor in architecture.

## Reading list
In a society where everything is instant, I find it very helpful to take a step back and read. It forces us to stay focused, teaches us to stay engaged, and allows us to view the world in a different light. Below, I have included books that I've really enjoyed, which I encourage you all to read!
